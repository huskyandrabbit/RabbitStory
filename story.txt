This is the beginning of a silly story for xxx. xxx really doesn't know what to write for this story, but xxx keeps writing.
Soon, xxx's trash can is full of scrap paper, but she is still lost on writing this story. xxx decides to go out and get some inspiration.
xxx walks outside and walks to a nearby trail. xxx sees many people and finds some friends. xxx asks what xxx should write about, but they were no use as they didn't know either. xxx then decides to go home and write about the story behind the making of her non story, which turned out to be a story!
